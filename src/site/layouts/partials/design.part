			<h2>Minimalist design</h2>
			<p>Just install the R package to feature a full-fledged VTL code editor with VTL syntax highlighting
				and code suggestions.</p>
			<p>Browse the results as you write, via just-in-time rule evaluation, and keep your model clean with a 
				top-down view of dependencies between the rules.</p>
			<p>Starting with the editor is as easy as installing the R package: no need for any other tool,
				such as databases, web servers, compilers or others.</p>
